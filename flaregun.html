So this app is based around the idea that people who have or are in
Dangerous situations can input a number into their phones and then it will send a signal to the relevant authorities, i.e: Police/Fire/Ambulance. People in domestic or experience other abuse can 
hopefully be able to get in contact without talking, so their abusers don't get suspicious. The hope is that
it will require direct response and investigation. People in terrible situations can't always articulate
and/or express their feelings and it'll also be a quick handy way for someone in an accident to get a hold of emergency authorities quickly
